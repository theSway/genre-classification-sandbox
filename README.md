# genre-classification-sandbox

This was a classification task for the course Machine Learning: Basic Principles. The students were given a dataset of relevant statistics extracted from music recordings. They were labeled into 10 different genres with great imbalances. The purpose was to compete with other student groups to achieve the best classification accuracy. Our group consisted of 2 students, where I was largely responsible for the coding and my partner did most of the literature review and parts of reporting. The final report was to be presented as a Jupyter notebook, but I wrote all my code in Pycharm and later adapted it for the notebook. This repository is simply an odd collection of scripts I wrote during data exploration and before I fully formed the spot-checking pipeline in Jupyter. You can get a good picture of the entire pipeline by reading the final report. Happy browsing! :)
